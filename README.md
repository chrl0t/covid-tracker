# Data Visualisation Practise - Covid Tracker

I have created this app with React to practise Data Visualisation with React using this api: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Here is a link to the live site: https://charlottes-covid-19-tracker.netlify.app/

## Run The App Locally:

In your terminal:

Check your version of Node.js - the minimum version of Node required to run locally is v14.8.0:

### `node --version`

Clone into the repo:

### `git clone https://github.com/chrl0t/covid-tracker`

### `cd covid-tracker`

Install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

Run the app:

### `npm start`

This should open up your locally hosted version of the app! ðŸ˜ƒ

# Planned Updates:

Make the site more responsive
